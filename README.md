### CSS Carousel
## A CSS animated carousel. Simple to drop-in, easy to skin.

Yes, another carousel, but this one is my own personal one which I want to be as lean and not rely on some kind of JS framework to make it work.

Most carousels out there I've found to be overkill, usually generating their own markup, classes, styles etc. When I start a project I want to be able to provide the HTML and CSS for laying it out, while using data-attributes to pass in functional components. There might be scope for adding JS resizing in the future.

My aim is to remove dependancies from all JS libraries. Support will be given for IE8, but not for css-transision related animations.

# Features
* Simple API for specifying a slide number, 'prev' or 'next'
